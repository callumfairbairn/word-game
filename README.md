## Instructions

The object of this game is to find as many words in the grid as possible within the time limit, where the each letter of the word is adjacent to the letter that preceded it.

For example, if the grid looked like this:

T U P I
B R B H
I A C E
P N T S

the word 'put' would be a valid word, as there is a 'P' which is next to a 'U' which is next to a 'T'. However, the word 'hat' would not be valid, as there is no 'A' next to an 'H', even though there is an 'A' next to a 'T'.

Type words in the input field, and press enter to submit them. Letters will highlight on the grid as you type, letting you visualise your input. If there are multiple ways to draw your input on the grid, the highlighting will reflect this. If your word is in the grid and in the dictionary, it will highlight green and increase your score depending on the difficulty and length of the word. The word will also appear in the found words box.

If you have entered a word but it is not in the dictionary, the letters will flash red. If your input is not on the board, no letters will be highlighted.

If your input matches a word that you have previously found, the letters will be highlighted in yellow.

Letters cannot be re-used within a word, meaning the the word 'set' would be valid in the grid above, but not 'sets'.

Once the time runs out, you will see a list of all the possible words that can be found in the grid, along with a heat map showing your most used letters in a darker shade of blue.

Refresh the page at any time to get a new grid and start the game again.

Enjoy!
